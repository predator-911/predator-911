👋 Hi, I’m @predator-911

👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Web Development.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques and enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to machine learning, especially those that involve data analysis, predictive modeling, and natural language processing. 
   I'm also open to working on web development projects that require building static or dynamic websites.

⚡ Fun fact: I love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm fascinated by how data can tell stories and drive innovation.
